## Quick Start Guide

### Docker Setup (current version only supports flux image generation model)

For users who prefer using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**
```bash
docker build -t heurist-miner:latest .
```
2. **Run the Docker Container**

Single GPU:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --gpus all \
  -e MINER_ID_0=0xWalletAddressHere \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  -v $HOME/.cache/heurist:/home/appuser/.cache/heurist \
  heurist-miner:latest
```

Replace `0xYourtWalletAddressHere` with your wallet address to receive rewards.

Multiple GPUs:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --gpus all \
  -e MINER_ID_0=0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere \
  -e MINER_ID_1=0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere \
  -e MINER_ID_2=0xYourThirdWalletAddressHere \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  -v $HOME/.cache:/home/appuser/.cache \
  heurist-miner:latest
```

Replace `0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere`, `0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere`, and `0xYourThirdWalletAddressHere` with your actual wallet addresses.

This command:
- Runs the container in detached mode (`-d`)
- Allows access to all GPUs (`--gpus all`)
- Sets environment variables for miner IDs and log level
- Mounts a volume for persistent cache storage
- Uses the image we just built (`heurist-miner:latest`)

Note: Ensure you have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed for GPU support in Docker.

### Local Setup

For experienced users, here's a quick overview to get you mining:

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heurist-network/miner-release.git
cd miner-release
```
2. **Set Up Environment**
- Install Miniconda (if not already installed)
- Create and activate a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name heurist-miner python=3.11
conda activate heurist-miner
```
3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Configure Miner ID**
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your Ethereum wallet address:
```bash
MINER_ID_0=0xYourWalletAddressHere
```

Follow "Multiple GPU Configuration" section if you have multiple GPUs.

5. **Choose Your Miner**

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Configuring Miner ID and Identity Wallet

Heurist Miner uses a dual-wallet system for security and reward distribution:

1. **Identity Wallet**: Used for authentication, stored locally. Do not store funds here.
2. **Reward Wallet (Miner ID)**: Receives points, Heurist Token rewards, potential ecosystem benefits.

#### Setting Up Your Wallets

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your miner installation.
2. Add your Ethereum wallet address(es) as Miner ID(s):
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere
   MINER_ID_1=0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere
   ```
3. (Optional) Add custom tags for tracking:
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere-GamingPC4090
   MINER_ID_1=0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere-GoogleCloudT4
   ```
4. Generate or import identity wallets:
   ```bash
   python3 ./auth/generator.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create new wallets or import existing ones.

     python3 sd-miner.py --auto-confirm yes
     ```
   - Options: yes, no (default: no)

3. **Exclude SDXL**
   - Exclude SDXL models to reduce VRAM usage:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --exclude-sdxl
     ```

4. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --model-id <model_id>
     ```

5. **CUDA Device ID**
   - Specify which GPU to use:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --cuda-device-id 0
     ```

#### Large Language Model Miner

For LLM miner, use the following CLI options to customize its behavior:

1. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model (mandatory):
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id>
     ```
   - Example: `dolphin-2.9-llama3-8b` (requires 24GB VRAM)

2. **Miner ID Index**
   - Specify which miner ID from the `.env` file to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --miner-id-index 1
     ```
   - Default: 0 (uses the first address configured)

3. **Port**
   - Set the port for communication with the vLLM process:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --port 8001
     ```
   - Default: 8000

4. **GPU IDs**
   - Specify which GPU(s) to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --gpu-ids 1
     ```
   - Default: 0

   - Example combining multiple options:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh dolphin-2.9-llama3-8b --miner-id-index 1 --port 8001 --gpu-ids 1
     ```

### Multiple GPU Configuration

To utilize multiple GPUs:

1. Assign unique Miner IDs in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xWalletAddress1
   MINER_ID_1=0xWalletAddress2
   ```
2. Set `num_cuda_devices` in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [system]
   num_cuda_devices = 2
   ```
3. Run the miner without specifying a CUDA device ID to use all available GPUs.


## Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Don't worry, we've got you covered! Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### Installation Issues

1. 🚨 **CUDA not found**
   - Ensure CUDA is properly installed
   - Check if the CUDA version matches PyTorch requirements<br>
   ✅ Solution: Reinstall CUDA or update PyTorch to match your CUDA version

2. 🚨 **Dependencies installation fails**
   - Check your Python version (should be 3.10 or 3.11)
   - Ensure you're in the correct Conda environment<br>
   ✅ Solution: Create a new Conda environment and reinstall dependencies

### Runtime Issues 

1. 🚨 **CUDA out of memory error**
   - Check available GPU memory using `nvidia-smi`
   - Stop other programs occupying VRAM, or use a smaller model<br>
   ✅ Solution: Add `--exclude-sdxl` flag for SD miner or choose a smaller LLM

2. 🚨 **Miner not receiving tasks**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your Miner ID is correctly set in the `.env` file<br>
   ✅ Solution: Restart the miner and check logs for connection issues

3. 🚨 **Model loading takes too long**
   - This is normal for large models, especially on first run
   - Check disk space and internet speed<br>
   ✅ Solution: Be patient (grab a coffee! ☕), or choose a smaller model

### Additional Tips

- 🔍 Always check the console output for specific error messages
- 🔄 Ensure you're using the latest version of the miner software
- 💬 If problems persist, don't hesitate to ask for help in our Discord community!

## FAQ

Got questions? We've got answers!

1️⃣ **Can I run both SD and LLM miners simultaneously?** 🖥️🖥️<br>
   🅰️ Absolutely! Just make sure you have enough GPU memory and use different CUDA device IDs.

2️⃣ **How do I know if I'm earning rewards?** 💰<br>
   🅰️ Keep an eye on your miner logs for successful task completions. We're tracking your rewards behind the scenes, and updates should be reflected on https://heurist.ai/portal within minutes.

3️⃣ **What's the difference between Identity Wallet and Reward Wallet?** 🎭💼<br>
   🅰️ Think of the Identity Wallet as your miner's passport (for authentication), and the Reward Wallet (Miner ID) as its piggy bank (for receiving points and rewards).

4️⃣ **Can I use my gaming PC for mining when I'm not gaming?** 🎮➡️💻<br>
   🅰️ Yes! Just remember to pause mining before starting the games. Your GPU can't be in two places at once!

5️⃣ **How often should I update the miner software?** 🔄<br>
